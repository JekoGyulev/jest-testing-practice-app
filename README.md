# Jest Practice App 🚀

This Node.js + Express app is intentionally designed to help you practice **Jest**.

## What you can test
- Unit tests for services and utils
- Async error handling
- Edge cases and thrown errors
- Route tests with Supertest
- Mocking dependencies
- Date & random ID behavior

## Rules
❌ No tests included on purpose  
✅ YOU write all the Jest tests  

## Suggested test ideas
- userService validation & errors
- orderService calculations
- discount edge cases
- API route integration tests
- Mock UUID, Date, Math.random

Have fun and break things 😄
